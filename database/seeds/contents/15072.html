If to explain this term with simple words, it is a way of reproducing an object or number of objects with the help of a computer by creating a 360° view. It means that you can look at the visualized 3D object from different angles and sides and analyze it to the smallest details as it is an accurate perfectly-designed model.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D visualization is a term that has many synonyms in the world of IT industry. Today it is also known as 3D rendering, 3D graphics or computer-generated imagery. The main purpose of all these processes is to create a high-quality digital graphics content and this technology is mainstreaming in this field nowadays.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D visualization is a unique process that allows an artist to visualize objects or processes that might not exist in the real world but do live in the person’s imagination. </span></p> </div></div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac13e5d03e0" > <h3 class="title"> Who performs 3D visualization? </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac13e5d0a18" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who create models with the help of the latest 3D software are called 3D artists. These are people with both artistic talent and a deep knowledge of modern technology. Of course, they can be assisted by renderers, designers, developers and other IT specialists but without a creative vision of the world, none of these professionals will be able to cope with 3D visualization. Similar to photographers, 3D artists should not only represent a beautiful vision of the future product but also create this well-versed high-quality model using professional software. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their main task is to transform the already designed by engineers CAD file or create a new 3D model from the scratch and achieve its excellent look by setting up virtual cameras, adjusting light and creating a necessary environment.</span></p> </div></div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac13e5d47cb" > <h3 class="title"> Who takes advantage of 3D visualization? </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac13e5d50f6" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most productive industry where 3D visualization plays a significant role is marketing and advertising. The biggest part of images and models we see online, on tv, billboards and in the magazines are products of 3D rendering. It is a quick and cost-effective way that has substitute the work of professional photographers. Today there is no need to look for a perfect background or catch the only possible shot &#8211; everything can be achieved thanks to the professional rendering software. It guarantees a full control over all aspects of imagery and allows creating such things that can be never produced by a photographer. The main benefit of 3D visualization is a possibility to create realistic images and models of the things that have not still been produced and are only a part of artistic imagination.</span></p> </div></div></div></div></div>
