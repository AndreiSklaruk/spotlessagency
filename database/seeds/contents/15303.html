That is why every home tour maker should consider the following tips trying to improve his creation.</p> <ol><li>Stage empty homes to provide an understanding of space</li></ol> <p>Every person wants to realize how he or she will live in the home for sale, but empty walls do not provide such an opportunity. However, it is also important not to overload this space with excessive pieces. Use several familiar objects to accentuate home features and show how vacant space can look staged.</p> <p>2. Create a bright consistent lighting around a home</p> <p>You surely know how photos of poorly lit rooms look like. Avoid this mistake creating a tour as well! Good lighting can not only add warmth and space to the room but also fill it with positive mood. Plan the positions of lighting crew in advance to shoot a quality realistic video.</p> <p>3. Let a viewer guide the tour</p> <p>If you switch on the video that moves around a house, it can not be called a virtual tour. The latter one should give a viewer a full control making it possible to zoom in details, switch between rooms, adjust a viewing angle etc. The longer a person looks at home, the more interest he has in this property &#8211; there are more positive memories about this home built.</p> <p>4. Prefer viewpoints located from the natural person’s perspective</p> <p>When you enter a home, you percept visual information at a certain height and distance. Your virtual tour should provide the same feeling.</p> <p>5. Shoot not only the home but also its connections to other spaces</p> <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/360-Virtual-Tour.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15311" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/360-Virtual-Tour.jpg 768w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/360-Virtual-Tour-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure> <p>If you create a 360-degree view of the room, try to show not only the room you are working at but also the way how it flows into another one or views outside the window too. It is also important to offer both home interior and the view of a home outside to create a nice curb appeal.</p> <p>6. Check your footage on site</p> <p>Always watch what you have shot on site to prevent possible errors. A strong wind or running dog may spoil your footage and it can be noticed only when you analyze it. Do that on site to be able to correct the mistakes.</p> <p>7. Optimize the file for mobile compatibility and good functioning on other devices</p> <p>Modern people get disappointed very quickly when they see low-quality technology. That is why it is important to optimize your tour for most of the popular mobile platforms as well as reduce loading time, latency, and crashing but leave a high resolution and quality.<br></p>
