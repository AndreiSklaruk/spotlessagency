Rendering is a process when data is taken in by a computer or software and processed to get an image or video. When you add changes to any image adjusting colors, textures, lighting and any other features you have to complete a number of commands including image rendering to get a final look. It is a time-consuming and painstaking process especially if to speak about creating visual effects in movies and video games. But today the technological progress has made all these processes almost instant and we can say about real-time rendering.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8a87f" > <h3 class="title"> What is real-time rendering? </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8ad5f" > <p>Real-time rendering is a rendering process that is happening at the moment of speaking and allows viewers to watch already generated videos or animations.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8af57" > <p>Every rendering process has to go through three main stages known as a visualization or rendering pipeline. They are:</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8b1cf" > <ul> <li><strong>Application;</strong></li> <li><strong>Geometry;</strong></li> <li><strong>Rasterizing.</strong></li> </ul> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8b3e1" > <p>It means that to create a model, render a <strong>3D object</strong>, adjust lighting, change textures etc. all these stages should be completed. It may seem unbelievable but that really happens at the incredible speed.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8b656" > <p><strong>Real-time rendering</strong> is not a new experience in the IT sphere. It has been used for years in the creation of video games so you can wonder why hasn’t it been taken advantage by other industries? The answer to this question is rather simple &#8211; it is both expensive and time-consuming process. In games, all the images, videos, animations were prepared and compiled in advance, but modern tools have taken real-time rendering to another level.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8b852" > <p>Today, it has been appreciated by many industries including design and real estate business. Modern designers can envision their creations in real time and accompany them with the abundance of physical effects to make them look more realistic.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8ba6e" > <h3 class="title"> Real-time rendering in design </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8bd18" > <p>Either designers or architects have come to the conclusion that real-time rendering offers a set of wonderful techniques quite recently. Now you can give any client a simple device and let him dive into a high-quality virtual tour without much effort. It will be more than just convincing for people who doubt to invest their money as well as customers who will be struck by the new experience.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8bf83" > <p>The main reasons that served as obstacles on the way of <strong>real-time rendering</strong> to the design industry were both money issues and unawareness how to implement it in this sphere. And when the cost of the services becomes more reasonable with the appearance of rendering specialists and powerful software, many designers are afraid to use it. Some experts say that both designers and architects do not wish to refuse from well pre-planned presentations because of the fear that customers can spot their mistakes. A perfect controllable presentation will never show customers those misplacing and design errors that can be easily detected in the real-life experience.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8c1c2" > <p>However, the implementation of real-time rendering is very important for improving the design process. As soon as a designer creates his project, he should not immediately present it to the customer. It is much more reasonable to offer this project for discussion and determine what was made right and what mistakes were made in it. As a result, the designer will grow professionally and improve the quality of the projects provided.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8c3cf" > <p>Of course, such changes will take place only with time and the increasing number of modern professional software users, but still, the first steps in this sphere have been already made.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8c645" > <h3 class="title"> Real-time rendering software </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8c90f" > <p>The development of modern programs and tools allowed to expand the number of real-time rendering software. They have acquired a variety of new features that make a rendering process even simpler and of the better quality. Together with such leaders as CAD, SketchUp, Photoshop, VRay, Octane, Indigo and Rhino, many new examples have rocked the world of design.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8cb1f" > <p>For example, LumenRT has a powerful Dynamic Immersive Visualization Engine that helps to adapt videos to a variety of circumstances and add multiple effects. It makes all the rendering processes on the fly.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8cd58" > <p>Another interesting app is RenderDigimania. You can opt for modeling and animating meshes in Maya or Max and then import them to the tool for animation rendering. It allows setting up lighting, arranging assets, and make other changes required. It was created for large production and animation studios so it is a highly powerful and effective application.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac0f0a8cfa2" > <p>Video Copilot creators have offered another Element 3D plugin that allows adding 3D items to 2D composite. It is suitable for users who have no 3D modeling experience, while the second version of the plugin guarantees even better realism and shadows.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> </div></div></div></div>
