It is important to measure all the room to get exact data and draw its sketch on the paper. It will allow you to distribute pieces of furniture around the room for a real arrangement to fit the room size. You can also do that not on the sheet of paper but using modern computer software and tools.</li> <li>Decide what will be a focal point of the room<br /> Every room should have a thing that will attract more attention than other pieces &#8211; it is called a focal point. In most cases it can be a fireplace, television, chandelier or picture. All the other furniture should contribute to the look of the focal point. The last one should be scaled properly to fit the room size and avoid looking odd. There is a general rule according to which you should have at least 3 feet of empty space around each object in the room.</li> <li>Make the furniture arrangement open<br /> Remember that all the pieces of furniture should as if welcome you in the room. It means that when you open the door, the should not be put directly with their back to you &#8211; it create an impression of an obstacle. Of course, it is impossible to locate every piece facing the door, but none of them should meet a person with its back.</li> <li>Get enough surfaces<br /> No matter whether it is a living room, bedroom or nursery there should be furniture pieces with the surface within arms reach. You will always have anything to put on it so these surfaces should be considered thoroughly. In the living room, it can be a coffee table, while in the bedroom this role belongs to bedside tables mainly. One more thing to consider is the level of this surface regarding other furniture pieces &#8211; it must be close.</li> <li>Think about movement around the room<br /> Of course, it is possible to stage a room with furniture very thoroughly, but will you achieve the goals set then? It is natural that every room will once be visited and there should be enough space to move around it. If a room has several entrances, they must be connected with a pathway between each other and have no obstacles on the way. You should provide easy access to every furniture item.</li> <li>Always use accessories<br /> Even a furnished room looks faceless without accessories. Simple curtains play such a significant role in making a room cozier, let alone other great decorative items. Remember about pictures, rugs, flowers, souvenirs and, of course, mirrors. Their strategically right positioning will make a great contribution to the well-built interior.</li> <li>Opt for symmetry in the room<br /> Symmetric interiors are more appealing and preferred by people. They have a completed look and create a special atmosphere in the room.</li> <li>Lighting<br /> Any luxurious furniture will look not impressive unless you consider lighting in the room. Dark areas, shades and different finish palette are only some of the challenges to cope with. It is preferable to get a mix of overhead lighting unless a chandelier is your focal point in the room. Another thing to consider is to fill the room with lighting placed at different levels to create a balance in the room.</li> </ol> </div></div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-gallery-sc gallery-wrap" id="norebro-custom-5eab17fe346f6" data-gallery="norebro-custom-5eab17fe346b9" > <div class="vc_row" data-lazy-container="true"> <div class="vc_col-lg-6 vc_col-md-6 vc_col-sm-12 vc_col-xs-12 metro-style masonry-block grid-item gallery-image" data-gallery-item="0" data-lazy-item="true"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="tmp-image" data-norebro-bg-image="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Living_room_staged-3.jpg"></div> <img class="gimg" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Living_room_staged-3.jpg" alt=""> <div class="overlay with-title"> <div class="content-center text-center"> <div class="wrap"> <h4 class="inline"> Living room Staged </h4> <div class="icon inline ion-ios-plus-empty"></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="gallery-description"> <h3 class="title">Living room Staged</h3> <p class="subtitle small"> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="vc_col-lg-6 vc_col-md-6 vc_col-sm-12 vc_col-xs-12 metro-style masonry-block grid-item gallery-image" data-gallery-item="1" data-lazy-item="true"> <div class="wrap"> <div class="tmp-image" data-norebro-bg-image="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Living_stagedI.jpg"></div> <img class="gimg" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Living_stagedI.jpg" alt=""> <div class="overlay with-title"> <div class="content-center text-center"> <div class="wrap"> <h4 class="inline"> Living room Staged </h4> <div class="icon inline ion-ios-plus-empty"></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="gallery-description"> <h3 class="title">Living room Staged</h3> <p class="subtitle small"> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="clear"></div> </div> </div> <div class="norebro-gallery-opened-sc gallery" id="norebro-custom-5eab17fe346b9" data-options='{"navClass":""}'> <div class="expand"> <span class="ion-android-expand"></span> </div> <div class="close"> <span class="ion-ios-close-empty"></span> </div> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> </div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eab17fe36006" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture staging is one of the most challenging tasks when you work with an empty room.
