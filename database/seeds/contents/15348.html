Despite the fact that ordinary people associate realtorâ€™s job with selling, buying or renting residential property, in fact, real estate agents also deal with commercial examples and it requires absolutely different skills and knowledge. In comparison with homes that can be sometimes sold staged, commercial property is most often offered vacant for sale. The reason for that is a much bigger potential of such property as it can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be an office, cafe, shop, storage space, and many other alternatives, so there is no sense to order actual staging solutions and narrow the functionality of this space. However, many modern realtors have already appreciated the benefits of virtual staging in this situation and it is not surprising why it happened.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15351" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-1920x1278.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Role of virtual staging for commercial property</strong></p> <p>Virtual staging is a perfect way to show the potential of the vacant commercial property. What differs it from actual staging? This service allows creating several faces of one space. It means that a potential buyer who looks for a vacant property for his business would immediately understand how he can take advantage of this space. </p> <p>Virtually staged photos are often added to the listings and their main task is to draw new viewers. Prospective buyers can rarely understand how one or another space can be used looking at the floor plan or photos of the empty property. It is natural that the potential buyers or people who want to rent commercial space also consider many other features including its location, size, state, but their potential is not less important. Moreover, virtual staging also allows overcoming the attributes that spoil the first impression about the property and show how to transform its negative sides into benefits. <br></p> <ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" data-id="15353" data-link="https://www.spotlessagency.com/?attachment_id=15353" class="wp-image-15353" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></li></ul> <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Virtual staging solutions for commercial real estate</strong></p> <p>Though the main purpose of the commercial real estate differs greatly from residential one, designers use the same staging solutions that are used for homes. The first thing a designer needs is quality photos of the empty commercial space. For this purpose, the property should be thoroughly decluttered and cleaned. It will bring about benefit not only to stage it virtually but also improve the first impression during the showing. Photos must be of the rather high quality and present the logical use of the space.</p> <p>As soon as a stager receives the photos, it is important to explain to him what type of commerce can be located there. As a result, he or she will spread the furniture and devices in the office, prepare space with dining tables and bar area in the restaurant or cafe as well as distribute shelves for any type of retail if required. It is a perfect way to optimize the use of the floor plan and present how this empty faceless room can look in the hands of the professional interior designer.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15352" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8-1920x1200.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <p>One more thing to consider is the choice of a visual staging company.
