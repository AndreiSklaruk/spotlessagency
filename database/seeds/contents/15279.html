There are many companies nowadays that offer virtual staging services, but unfortunately, not all of them understand what is acceptable and what is forbidden in this business.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual staging is a process of adding furniture and decorative items to the real photos of empty property using modern software. However, some people do not consider this definition full or make changes in it. As a result, we get not virtual staging but another process with similar features. That is why it is important to remember what is not referred to and what can not be considered virtual staging.</span></p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 15px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" > <div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class='twentytwenty-container twentytwenty-custom'> <img src='/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/living_room_3_1.jpg' alt="Virtual staging before"> <img src='/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/living_room_3_2_staged.jpg' alt="Virtual staging after"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac141d60f2d" > <ol class="ol-brand"> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editing and changing real photos</span><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual staging is applied to only real photos. These are usually quality photos of vacant homes that can be staged virtually. Any editing of the existing photos is not acceptable in the virtual staging process. It means that you want to cheat the potential buyers changing anything in the home.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering or hiding real home features</span><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is natural that there are no homes in a perfect state. Every property might have minor or huge drawbacks and virtual staging must not be a goal to hide it. If there are any cracks, damages or a bad view from the window, it would be unfair to cover it fully using virtual furniture pieces or thick curtains. The main purpose of virtual staging is to make a home more appealing but not to deceive people.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making modifications to the property</span><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is natural that every home can be renovated and modified if you wish that, but virtual staggers should not do that. You can not install a new window in the wall or change a pathway in the yard. A stager can surround them with beautiful accessories and objects without making any changes in the existing look of the home. If the following modifications are explained by the necessity to make a home more attractive to the buyers, unfortunately, this process cannot be called virtual staging then.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding staged photos to the listings without mentioning that</span><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The main negative viewpoint connected with virtual staging is calling it ‘deceive’. Many experts agree that virtually staged homes do not show the reality and serve as a chance to attract clients in an unjust way. However, every staging company warns its clients to mention in every listing that contains virtually staged photos about this fact for people not to be disappointed on showing. Most of the people come to a vacant home with the staged images in the hands to compare and leave the property satisfied as these photos can be implemented in reality without much effort. As a result, it has nothing to do with cheating and shows a potential of the home.</span></li> </ol> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 15px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" > <div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class='twentytwenty-container twentytwenty-custom'> <img src='/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/bedroom_3_3.jpg' alt="Virtual staging before"> <img src='/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/bedroom_staged_3_4.jpg' alt="Virtual staging after"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac141d622b0" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern technological advancement made it possible to invent a variety of options and processes performed with the help of the computer. Virtual staging is one of them, and according to the definition of this term, there are some aspects that cannot be accepted in this process. If any of the actions mentioned above take place during the staging process, the final product you get cannot be called a virtually staged one. This truth is admitted by many reputable staging companies and should serve as a guideline for beginners to prevent them from tough mistakes.</span></p> </div></div></div></div></div>
