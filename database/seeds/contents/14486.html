That is why it became popular today to order professional virtual staging services of empty or partially staged property to make the listing more appealing to buyers. 94% of real estate agents confirm the fact that virtually staged homes are sold faster, up to 42%. It can also be said that <a href="https://www.pinheadsinteractive.com/360-virtual-tour-change-real-estate/">360 virtual reality tour improves real estate industry</a>, helping potential buyers visualize themselves in that property, even when they&#8217;re not physically there. Why does it happen? The answer is simple. Empty homes have never looked welcoming and desired by buyers. The biggest number of people need to fall in love with their new home and it can happen only when they are able to see its greatest potential. In fact, only one tenth of the people can do it looking at an empty room. The rest of 90% need to see that with their own eyes to believe and accept that. For such people, virtual staging can become a decisive factor in favor of one or another home for sale.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional designers and architects make empty property unbelievably attractive.
