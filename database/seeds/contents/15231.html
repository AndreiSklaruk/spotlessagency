Some companies even offer a regular monthly number of services for a rather competitive price for large firms and agencies. Rush orders and furniture replacement are more expensive than virtual staging services too.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, if you need to stage an apartment that includes such rooms as a living room, bedroom, kitchen and den the price for virtual staging services may vary between $250 and $1,000. However, it is important to remember that it is only 10% of the total cost of real staging, but the number of benefits you get is not much fewer.</span></p> </div></div></div></div></div>
