Placing your orders for virtually staged properties, real estate agents should be aware of the fact that some masterly staged rooms can have a major impact on buyers than others. Here is Top-5 rooms you can&#8217;t ignore while applying to any of the best virtual staging companies:</p> <ol> <li>The living room is considered to be the most important room to be staged as it plays a significant role in homeowners lives. It is the place where family members gather each day and where they host and entertain their guests. It also includes lots of decor elements that form an impression about property owners, one way or another living room displays their character.</li> <li>Kitchen. Some people believe that kitchen is the heart of every home. In this room, we take care of our nearest and dearest cooking meals that fill our bodies and then minds. Potential buyers often want it to be convenient, functional and well-designed and are interested in optimal solutions in its furnishing and decor. In these regards, virtual staging for realtors can be really helpful.</li> <li>Master bedroom. Certainly, pictures of this room should be associated with comfort, relax and ease, so your buyer will be so much happy to see the big comfortable bed on it as well as reasonable furniture placement and sweet decorations. No doubts, that such kind of photo is likely to appeal the client rather than an image of empty rooms and bare walls.</li> <li>Children&#8217;s bedroom. Any comments are pointless here, every family if they have kids want to make sure their rooms will be comfortable, safe and beautiful at the same time &#8211; particularly this result can be easily achieved with virtual staging.</li> <li>The bathroom is a room where even square footage cannot limit original decor choices, so provide a couple of reference images and every professional virtual stager will create fantastic space that will obviously gladden your client.</li> </ol> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> </div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-6"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img width="500" height="333" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ronita_388_Bridge_St_Kids_room_1.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ronita_388_Bridge_St_Kids_room_1.jpg 500w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ronita_388_Bridge_St_Kids_room_1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></div> </figure> </div> <div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img width="500" height="334" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jared_One57157West57thStreet_second_bedroom-1.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jared_One57157West57thStreet_second_bedroom-1.jpg 500w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jared_One57157West57thStreet_second_bedroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></div> </figure> </div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac13a960fdb" > <p>Virtual staging of rooms made by us</p> </div></div></div></div><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-6"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img width="500" height="333" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Melanie_Loftus250_Bowery_Dining_living_room_1.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Melanie_Loftus250_Bowery_Dining_living_room_1.jpg 500w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Melanie_Loftus250_Bowery_Dining_living_room_1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></div> </figure> </div> <div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img width="500" height="333" src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Inanna_533_Leonard_Bathroom_1.jpg" class="vc_single_image-img attachment-full" alt="" srcset="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Inanna_533_Leonard_Bathroom_1.jpg 500w, https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Inanna_533_Leonard_Bathroom_1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></div> </figure> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac13a966b8d" > <p><strong>Virtual staging in business &#8211;
