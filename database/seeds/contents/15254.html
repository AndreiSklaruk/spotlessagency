It creates an impression that a room has a designer interior, looks more attractive and gives the understanding how spacious it is and what fits it.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actual or home staging is the same process of creating a beautiful interior by a hired designer to show how comfortable and good this place can be. A designer can use the existing furniture pieces and add some decor and accessories or create something absolutely new with purchased pieces.</span></p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 15px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_inner vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-6"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img class="vc_single_image-img" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/virtual1.jpg" /></div><figcaption class="vc_figure-caption">Virtual staging</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div></div></div><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-6"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class="wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center"> <figure class="wpb_wrapper vc_figure"> <div class="vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey"><img class="vc_single_image-img" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/real1.jpg" /></div><figcaption class="vc_figure-caption">Real staging</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 40px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eac04ab11eda" > <h3 class="title"> Can virtual staging substitute a real one? </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac04ab12702" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual staging is not a new concept in the real estate market. However, its great efficiency has been appreciated only several years ago. Nowadays many realtors agree that virtual staging is a necessity in the real estate market because only 10% of all people can see the potential of the empty property without visualization techniques. All the rest need help in this tough task and virtual staging can be a way out in this situation.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there is a thought that virtual staging serves as an attraction to the potential buyers who have to get disappointed when they turn up at the showings of a vacant home. As a result, people refuse to buy a property that does not correspond to the listings, even if they were warned about that. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more controversy connected with virtual staging lies in the question: can it substitute real staging fully? Today it is used as an alternative to home staging. Its main purpose is to make listings more appealing to the viewers and show how this empty space can be used with benefit. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that actual staging takes place when one of the goals is to make beautiful listing photos. However, it is not the main purpose of this process. People order real staging services to increase the cost of the property for sale. Unfortunately, virtual staging can not cope with this task. At the same time, it is important to remember that virtual staging costs almost ten times cheaper than an actual one. Here you can ask a question: is it reasonable to invest several thousand dollars in home staging and how much can it increase the cost of the property?</span></p> </div><div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac04ab12922" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a homeowner does not have this money or realizes that real staging will not help him to sell the property for a bigger price, but he understands that it must be sold faster, the only right solution in this situation is to order quality virtual staging services. You get two benefits immediately:</span></p> </div><div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac04ab12c1f" > <ul class="ul-brand"> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your property listings more appealing and viewed, so increase the chances of selling it quicker;</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a buyer with a perfect interior project that can be fulfilled if he likes it.</span></li> </ul> </div><div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eac04ab12e8e" > <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people who buy empty property plan to adjust it to their personal preferences and might never use the decor and furnishing for which a seller has paid money, so there is no point in wasting this sum. That is why every property owner should come to the conclusion what results he is waiting for from staging and only then choose one or another type.</span></p> </div></div></div></div></div>
