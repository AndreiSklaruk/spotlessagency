They have been used for <strong>about 3 years</strong> only and firstly were created only for luxury property to impress the potential and wealthy buyers. I can imagine <a href="https://www.eddieyan.ca/burnaby-homes-condos-for-sale/" alt="" title="">Eddie Yan homes for sale</a> will probably take advantage of this fantastic technology at some point. It is not a secret that rich people can afford going to different corners of the world to see the property they wish to buy, but the appearance of 3D virtual tours has simplified this procedure as you can <strong>see a home on sale without leaving your home, real estate agency office or country</strong>. Moreover, the first 3D tours required new technological devices and software and were rather expensive so ordinary sellers could not afford it. However, when real estate agents have appreciated the benefits 3D tours bring, a demand for this service was growing and more and more companies began to offer similar services. That allowed to make the price lower and spread the service to the property with the average cost. It would be interesting to see a real estate tour for different places.

However, there is <strong>still some space to develop for these tours as well</strong>.</p> <p>When we watch TV, a culinary show, for example, there is always a desire to touch the dish, feel its mouth-watering smell. Unfortunately, a video does not offer that experience and the same situation is with 3D tours. A viewer can not touch the wall to feel the pattern of the wallpapers, understand if there is any smell of old furniture or animals etc.</p> <p>However, a video shot somewhere like this <a href="https://www.onepearlbank-official.com.sg/location/" alt="" title="">One Pearl Bank Location</a> can give the viewer a better idea of the neighbourhood vibe, any colour schemes and lighting, things that cannot be ascertained from still photography alone.</p> <p>According to the photographers, 3D cameras can wrap objects as well as ordinary cameras and there are limitations with natural and additional light as you can not use the last ones in dark interiors. That means that dark rooms remain gloomy and in addition, there can be some changes in the video due to differences in temperature in different rooms. Such it may seem non-significant drawbacks of 3D tours might need some improvement and it is likely that these changes will soon happen.</p> <p>One more improvement that will concern 3D virtual tours in future is an <strong>opportunity to change some interior items at the moment of watching the tour</strong>. Today, you will not impress anyone with <a href="/blog/real-estate-photography-should-it-be-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staged photos</a>, but soon people might get an opportunity to try one or another piece of furniture in the home the tour around of which they take.</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-heading-sc heading text-left" id="norebro-custom-5eab2952f10ae" > <h3 class="title"> Job perspectives provided by 3D real estate tours </h3> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="wpb_video_widget wpb_content_element vc_clearfix vc_video-aspect-ratio-169 vc_video-el-width-100 vc_video-align-center" > <div class="wpb_wrapper"> <div class="wpb_video_wrapper"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aq4NLmiJHwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div> </div> <div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> <div class="norebro-text-sc" id="norebro-custom-5eab2952f346d" > <p>Modern companies do not wish to lose a new direction of getting profit and create new departments that deal with 3D tours not only in real estate but also in hotel and restaurant, tourism business and many other ones.

Technology does not stand in one place and something that seems impossible today will more likely happen in a couple of months or years. The only conclusion that can be made today is that the <strong>probability that 3D virtual tours will replace customary for real estate photographs is very high </strong>so this innovation should not be underestimated by those real estate agencies that have not tried it yet. It is time to start, undoubtedly!</p> </div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 25px" ><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div> </div></div></div></div>
