One of such latest solutions is artistic architectural visualization where details and the general look of the visual acquire some extraordinary unrealistic and thematic features.

If it is an artistic rendering, it is more difficult to understand them as people might have an absolutely different vision of the same picture described with words.

The second way to improve your listings by staging is the virtual one. Its main benefits are showing the potential of the empty property, the attraction of more viewers, and as a result, faster sale of this property. However, virtual staging has another huge advantage for both property owners and realtors: it saves money. How can it happen? There are several ways to get all the benefits provided by virtual staging and spent a little.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]The possibilities of <strong>virtual staging </strong>are endless.

According to the website, it can increase the selling price up to 20%.

It is a way not only to save but even earn more.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" title="Q29zdC1lZmZlY3RpdmVuZXNz" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]The second example of saving money with <strong>virtual staging</strong> is based on the cost of the services. In comparison with traditional staging, there is no need to pay money to a designer for a consultation. Moreover, you prevent yourself from spending hundreds of dollars per monthly payment as it is enough to pay once to get every room staged and the cost of the services is ten times cheaper than traditional staging.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" title="QWJpbGl0eSUyMHRvJTIwRElZ" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]There are several more ways to save on <strong>virtual staging</strong> though the final product does not guarantee the efficacy it could bring about if done by experts. Virtual staging requires quality photographs so you can avoid hiring a professional photographer and do these photos yourself. Of course, it is better to prepare for such process and at least read out how to make them look better. Another way to stage your property virtually without extra expenses is to use the DIY software. You may try to stage rooms yourself using the latest tools and apps as they are available on the Web, but, unfortunately, it will differ greatly from the work of professional stagers. Virtual staging companies employ creative 3D artists who not only add furniture pieces but create a real composition.

It is another way to save money as you not only avoid spending money on transportation but also do not waste your valuable time on people who are only interested. This precious time can be spent on earning extra money, for example. Another great thing is the absence of necessity to spend money on keeping the property in constant order and excellent state. It can spend several months in the market and each time on showings it is necessary to bring it to a perfect state for the potential buyers.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]At the same time, the potential buyers still have a chance to explore the property to the smallest details and do not need to visit it.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13333" img_size="full"][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" title="QnV5ZXJzJUUyJTgwJTk5JTIwYmVuZWZpdCUyMGZyb20lMjB2aXJ0dWFsJTIwc3RhZ2luZw==" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Buyers can also save money on buying property that is staged only virtually. It goes without saying that the cost of traditional staging is included in the total amount. As a result, people buy property with furniture that might not be appealing to them. It means that they pay for the things they would like to get rid of - is there any sense? Virtual staging does not make buyers feel frustrated as they pay for the property, not any other non-significant items attached to it.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" title="U2F2aW5nJTIwb24lMjBhcmNoaXRlY3R1cmFsJTIwc29sdXRpb25z" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>Virtual staging</strong> and modeling are also savvy for architectural firms.

Often, lack of designer skills or the absence of desire to keep order by the home discourage the potential buyers. Every person wishes to buy a perfect house so any staging mistakes, outdoor ones, in particular, are a huge drawback. It''s important that you think of any imperfection, even small things you wouldn''t think would put anyone off. For example, if you have any missing or chipped tiles on your roof, it can make the potential buyer think there are further issues with the house. Getting Ace Roofing (<a href="https://aceroofingtexas.com/" alt="" title="">https://aceroofingtexas.com/</a>) to replace these faults can be the difference between a sale or not.

There is hardly anything more convincing than lounge chairs with cushions, a coffee table, an umbrella to save from bright sunlight or a uniform set of <a href="https://www.ottena.co.uk/">teak furniture</a>.

Nobody wishes to buy a home and take away someone''s rubbish. Even if these things might be precious for current owners as they provoke moving memories, for new owners they will be considered rubbish. This is why current owners who are moving out should hire a removals company, or a moving company to help them rid of their things. Whether they require <a href="https://www.h2hmovers.com/long-distance-movers-chicago/">long distance movers</a> or movers for a trip down the street there is certainly someone out there to assist you with your move, so you don''t leave it all for the next home owners to clear up.

Of course, it is impossible to do that in late fall or winter,  but most homes with outdoor space are most often sold in summer and spring, so if you prepare your home for selling, add a hint of nature to more functional areas.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Any of these mistakes will discourage a potential buyer even if you order professional designer to stage your outdoor space.

First of all, it is a salary a designer wishes to get. The range of prices is extremely large so you should realize if this person deserves the money he asks for. Too cheap and very expensive services should be treated with suspicion as cheap usually means of poor quality while too high prices rarely justify themselves. It would be right to choose a professional who estimates his work reasonably and asks an average price. Especially if you are designing an office for people to work in as an office that looks bad will not motivate your employees very much, costing you more in the long run!

If you hear a negative answer or an immediate agreement, these are reasons to doubt. A professional will at least think for a while making some basic counts or offer to prepare a preliminary report to get an approximate cost of the whole project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fourth</strong>, ask a designer how he expects to be paid.

Moreover, the first 3D tours required new technological devices and software and were rather expensive so ordinary sellers could not afford it.

However, there is <strong>still some space to develop for these tours as well</strong>.</p>\r\nWhen we watch TV, a culinary show, for example, there is always a desire to touch the dish, feel its mouth-watering smell. Unfortunately, a video does not offer that experience and the same situation is with 3D tours.

Such it may seem non-significant drawbacks of 3D tours might need some improvement and it is likely that these changes will soon happen.\r\n\r\nOne more improvement that will concern 3D virtual tours in future is an <strong>opportunity to change some interior items at the moment of watching the tour</strong>.

Let’s look at <em>virtual staging benefits</em> and the answer will be clear:[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Only 10% of people can visualize property</em>, so virtual staging can help clients to understand how this home will look like if they buy it;</li>\r\n 	<li><em>Virtual staging is very cost-effective</em> in comparison with physical staging and usually, all the spendings return back together with the actual price of the property;</li>\r\n 	<li><em>You can change the look of your home</em> depending on the season or preferences, as the photo can be modified anytime;</li>\r\n 	<li>Virtual home staging <em>takes from a couple of hours to several days</em>, so you should not wait for a long period of time;</li>\r\n 	<li>Staged images will make your property <em>stand out in the listings</em>;</li>\r\n 	<li>It can transform a home under construction into a <em>luxurious mansion with warm atmosphere</em> - virtual staging power <a href="/blog/what-is-virtual-staging-how-does-it-work">seems endless</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]These are only some of the benefits mentioned by real estate agents about virtual staging. In general, it is quite difficult to estimate all the advantages of this method as much depends on the property, professionalism of the real estate agent or quality of the services provided - the only right answer that is obvious is the fact that <strong>virtual staging has a positive impact on selling the property</strong>, undoubtedly.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13505" img_size="full"][norebro_text]<strong>Example of virtually staged room by Spotless Agency</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" heading_type="h2" title="SG93JTIwZG9lcyUyMHZpcnR1YWwlMjBzdGFnaW5nJTIwaW5mbHVlbmNlJTIwcmVhbCUyMGVzdGF0ZSUyMHByaWNlJTNG" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]One more unmatched benefit of virtual staging is always mentioned by realtors. What is it? Naturally, it is a <strong>possibility of virtual staging to increase the real estate price</strong>. Unfortunately, there are no studies that prove its unmatched positive influence on the real estate price but many realtors confirm this fact from their personal practice.\r\n\r\nTwo popular virtual staging studies were conducted in 2012 and 2015. The first study was organized by a real estate professor who said that the <em>evaluations of homeowners did not have many differences on the basis of staging conditions</em>. The second study was more extensive. Three professors of real estate and finance <strong>Michael Seiler</strong>, <strong>Mark Lane</strong> and <strong>Vicky Seiler</strong> offered buyers several alternatives including:[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Unfurnished vacant home;</li>\r\n 	<li>Home with awful furniture pieces;</li>\r\n 	<li>Home with beautiful furnishing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]According to the results, <em>all the homes were estimated at almost the same price independently of the furniture placed there</em>. Of course, nice pieces of furniture made a home more livable and could <a href="/blog/sell-your-property-faster-with-spotless-virtual-staging-agency">speed up the selling process</a>, but they have not influenced the final price at all.\r\n\r\nDespite the results of both research types many real estate agents still admit that staging has some beneficial impact on the property price. It is explained by the emotions that overwhelm the potential buyers when they see listings. If a staged property has been appreciated by a person, he will pay up the initial price for it not to be sold to anyone else.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13506" img_size="full"][norebro_text]<strong>Example of virtually staged apartments by Spotless Agency</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]Of course, in this case, the probability of getting such profit is quite little, but a seller can try to set a bit higher price in comparison with the average one from the very beginning and it will become clear if anyone is interested in it within a couple of weeks already. That is the main reason why <em>there are no official results of surveys and types of research about the influence of staging on real estate price</em>, but practical experience of many real estate experts should not be neglected as well.\r\n\r\nVirtual staging offers a variety of benefits and increased property price is among them too. There were hundreds of situations when <em>staging added value to homes on sale, so it will not be right not to take into account this great benefit</em>.

Though it may seem that there can’t be anything dangerous in selling a property, there are life situations when even sellers turn out to be cheated. To avoid such cases you should look at your potential buyer closer. Some clients have a variety of other goals except for paying money for the home, so it is important to recognize that from the very beginning and refuse him. How can you do that? Look through <em>7 characteristics of the clients</em> that do not deserve your attention and time.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>1. Never come to the appointment</strong>\r\nTime is money and there is no sense in devoting more time to those who have once set an appointment date and time and never come. It means that the client''s intentions to buy property not serious and do not exist at all. Of course, there are life situations that may prevent you from coming, but in this case, at least a call of excuse is a necessity.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>2. Rude and offensive</strong>\r\nNo matter how patient and strong your personality is, it should not stand out abuse in any case. If you realize that your behavior and words could not lead to such loathsome actions, it means that there is hardly anything good to wait from this person. You can also ask a better treatment, of course, but even if these requests are also ignored, it is time to turn down.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>3. Caught Lying</strong>\r\nDishonesty is a negative trait not only for a client. It is better not to have business with people who you can’t trust at all. Dealing with them may bring about many unexpected troubles. For not being accused of any illegal actions it is always better to get an assistance of a professional lawyer or find another client.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>4. Impossible to understand</strong>\r\nIt goes without saying that a foreign language can become a barrier to understand the wishes and questions of the client. Of course, in this case, a realtor should at least hire a translator or offer another real estate agent knowledgeable in this language. But sometimes people may speak the <em>same language and still not understand each other</em>. They seem to come from another planet and everything they say sounds alien. In this case, you may offer such people to find another agent who might understand their preferences better and offer examples.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>5. Falling out of your niche</strong>\r\nEvery agent majors at selling a different property. Some realtors deal with homes, the others - with apartments and flats, while the third group offers offices and business accommodation. If your client asks you to find a building for a shop and you center on selling villas and cottages, it is advisable to recommend him or her another professional.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>6. Strange and unrealistic</strong>\r\nA job of the realtor involves communication with many people. You can meet a <em>variety of individualities</em> and it is important to find the approach to everyone. But you are also not insured from people, whose vision of the world seems unrealistic. It might be a seller who believes that his hut is worth one million dollars or a buyer who desires to buy a mansion for a couple of thousand dollars. Of course, your task is to try to explain to such people that their wishes are impossible to fulfill. However, if that does not work, it is always better to refuse rather than suffer from their intrusions.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>7. Always finding excuses</strong>\r\nIt happens that some clients can’t or <em>do not wish to make a final decision</em> about buying property and waste your time with an abundance of excuses. A hint of hesitation of such personalities may transform into the fear of making a deal and they may play on your nerves for months. That is why when you get 2-3 strange excuses from your clients, it is better to stop reminding of yourself as there is hardly any sense in that.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\nPeople who sell anything are always happy to have clients. At the same time, not all the clients that appear in front of you will make up a deal. Some of them can only waste your time and spoil your mood. That is why you should learn how to differentiate real and fake clients and be ready to refuse some of them. That will help you to <a href="/blog/sell-your-property-faster-with-spotless-virtual-staging-agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell more property</a> within a shorter period of time.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]', '7 Clients You Should Turn Down', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', '7-clients-you-should-turn-down', '', '', '2018-06-11 14:49:47', '2018-06-11 12:49:47', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=13508', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Why does it happen? Unfortunately, it may be the result of rough mistakes made by the seller. Today it is important to make up a strategy to sell a home for the reasonable money and within a short period of time. Some people ignore this not understanding that in 2017 it is not enough to make several amateur photos and set the price. That is why there is a list of sellers'' common mistakes to avoid and be more successful with selling homes.

Too high price</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]One of the <strong>main things that terrify</strong> interested people even from looking through the listing photos <strong>is an unpredictably high price.</strong> It is a natural desire to get more for the product you sell but getting nothing is several times worse than getting less.\r\n\r\n<em>Overpricing results</em> in the fact that the estate remains on the market for a longer period of time and that leads to a lower final price. Buyers never hurry to buy a thing if they see that it has been on sale for a long time and can stay there for some time more. Moreover, the ad can even not be seen by them as your home will be excluded from the buyer''s narrowed search results because of the high price.\r\n\r\nThat is why <strong>it is important to set the right price</strong>. To determine it one can look through the listings with similar estate and prices for them or ask for professional help. Being aware of the market and the neighborhood, the house benefits and drawbacks a real estate agent will tell the minimum and maximum you can ask for it. Want to sell your house as soon as possible?

Saving money on photographs, staging, and repairs</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<em>Every real estate should be prepared for sale.</em> It is natural that the first impression influences the decision to look at a home or not but also can be a decisive factor whether it is worth buying it. It does not mean that you have to invest a huge sum of money in it but minor repairs, as well as a professional promotion, are a necessity. Say, for example, your drains are blocked. You should look for <a href="https://www.thereliningcompany.com.au/blocked-drains/blocked-drains-kensington/">Plumbers near me who clean blocked drains in Kensington</a> to handle the situation to get it sorted properly. That way, there will be no lingering smell, and you can know there will be no issues on inspection. If you''re looking to make some quick repairs on your home before putting it on the market, you may want to look at taking out a small payday loan which <a href="https://www.lendingexpert.co.uk/loans/payday/">are known as short-term loans</a>. You could get a long-term loan, although a short-term loan could be a better choice. (Read: <a href="/blog/how-to-prepare-house-for-sale-5-home-staging-tips-ideas">How To Prepare Your House For Sale: 5 Home Staging Tips & Ideas</a>).\r\n\r\nThe main thing for buyers is the impression they have when they see it for the first time. It concerns both photos and showings. That is why you should <em>make only professional photos</em> of the already upgraded or repaired home. These photos will be also useful for staging the home as the staged estate is sold three times faster and for asking money or even higher. It proves the fact that these are not the things to save on.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_video link="https://youtu.be/FEGGN9wHLAM" align="center"][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<strong>3.

But it is only the top of the iceberg. Think only about incessant calls, showings, and regular promotion. <strong>Only a professional can emphasize the benefits and keep silent about the drawbacks of the estate.</strong>\r\n\r\nMoreover, realtors always have contacts of professional photographers, stagers, and repairmen to make all the preparations. But the most important thing is a title insurance. It guarantees protection for homeowners against the property''s title defects that can become a reason of litigation or bureaucratic problems. <strong>Realtor''s help will prevent you from meeting many underwater stones while the commission can be discussed if you do not wish to lose money. </strong>(Read: <a href="/blog/home-staging-statistics-that-may-surprise-you">Home Staging Statistics That May Surprise You</a>)[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13547" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Living room Virtually Staged by  <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotless Agency</a>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<strong>4.

Seller''s presence during showings</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Many sellers make a great mistake being present on showings together with a real estate agent. If you decided to hire a realtor, what is the purpose to visit showings? Seller''s main objective is to get money for the goods he or she sells and it plays no role who will become a new owner of the property.\r\n\r\n<strong>Seller''s presence has several more negative sides</strong>. <em>First of all</em>, it does not give the potential buyers freedom to feel at home as the real owner will follow them here and there. Another issue is the questions buyers may ask. When these questions are addressed to the realtor, he will provide necessary information. However, some of them may sound like an intrusion into the personal life of the current owners but their absence will make the communication more vivid and natural as well as allow people to learn everything they are interested in.\r\n\r\n<em>One more reason</em> for the owners to leave showings is situations when buyers can not express their real feelings about the property worrying not to offend the owners. Such showings will only result in tension and absence of accurate decisions, and that is nothing good for a seller.\r\n\r\nThese mistakes of sellers will result in the fact that their property would spend much more time on the market and they would have to make significant discounts to speed up the sales. Of course, nobody will be satisfied with such results, so it is important to think about the selling process thoroughly and let the professional plan it. It will save your time, effort and money as well as make the process fun rather than a burden.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][/vc_column][/vc_row]', 'Top 5 Home Selling Mistakes To Avoid In 2017', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'home-selling-mistakes-to-avoid-in-2017', '', '', '2018-06-11 14:45:28', '2018-06-11 12:45:28', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=13544', 0, 'post', '', 0);

You can find a place to the most unusual objects in this style and what is more, they will seem to have been there for ages. <em>The main advantage of the Eclectic style is independence from stereotypes and rules and possibility to create rules with your own mind and hands.

Contrast is the basis of mismatching</strong>\r\n\r\nThe energy of Eclecticism is taken from contrast so you will hardly find some similar elements in this style. On the other hand, even if all the pieces look very differently, there should be a common ground to unite them in this style. It is necessary to choose several anchor must-have elements and add the variety of decor in regard to them. It is also important to create parallels for the room not to look overstaffed.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13613" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Bedroom Virtual Staging by Spotless Agency[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<strong>2. Repetition for rhythm</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we speak about repetition, it does not obligatory mean to have two absolutely identical elements in one room. It can be a repetition of forms or colors for the room to look rhythmic. Most of these elements are determined only after setting up the fundamental pieces as they create a motif and atmosphere.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]<strong>3. Think of proportions and a general composition</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13614" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Living room Virtual Staging by Spotless Agency[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]The room interior must be balanced for it to be pleasant to be in.

Diversify the textures</strong>\r\n\r\nSometimes the interior can be understood only by touch. The Eclectic style welcomes different textures that even might be opposite to each other. <em>Smooth and soft surfaces</em> should be combined with rough and hard ones. Shiny elements need a company of matte ones. Wood and glass will look especially interesting if combined with metal and stone. Every element should have its character and texture but still be an indispensable part of the wholesome Iook.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_single_image image="13615" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Bedroom Virtual Staging by Spotless Agency[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<strong>5. Simple and clear background for eye-catching decor</strong>\r\n<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1522243249221_2463">The Eclectic style is mainly based on elements of decor and furniture that are collected in the single room, so the background for these items should not compete with them - it must be plain, neutral and simple.</p>\r\n<strong>6. Colors should be cohesive with patterns</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Eclectic style has no restrictions in <em>combining colors and shades</em>, so you can play with them according to your wishes. However, your task is not to overdo. Preferring bright and colorful patterns opt for softer background colors or vice verse. It is impossible to feel great living in the overwhelming rooms.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Don’t be afraid to surprise</strong>\r\n<p class="text-align-left"><em>The feeling of surprise is another feature of the Eclectic style. </em>That is why any element that may strike the eyesight is admissible in it.

In general, this notion is associated with things that happen "at the moment", but in design, there is a bit different accent. It is based on the conventions of the traditional decor and makes a <strong>strong emphasis on lines and forms</strong>. The <strong>rooms designed in the conventional style have much open space and natural light</strong>, so every element must be thoroughly considered.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest misunderstanding connected with its style is its toss with modern style (Read:Bedroom virtual staging by <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotless Agency</a>). Of course, there are some common features in both of these styles, but the number of differences is even more significant. <em>Modern style has appeared in the 20th century and there are strict guidelines formulated. In the contemporary style, the frames are a not so restricted as it admits breaking the rules and is more fluid.</em>\r\n\r\nOne more peculiarity of the contemporary style is its changing characteristics. Only current trends can be referred to the contemporary design and everything that was in trend 5 years ago, for example, is considered old-fashioned here. However, in a couple of years, these trends can be completely different too.

Of course, it does not mean that only these colors can be met in the contemporary design. There should be a play of colors with a hint, touch or shade of others.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Clear straight lines make an impression of simplicity and cleanliness.</strong>\r\n\r\nAll the elements are grounded and have no decorative items. The orientation is along a horizontal axis in everything including furniture and architecture. The key is to focus on simple geometric forms like squares, cylinders, waves or circles.

You can make a minor refurbishment and bring the area around the house in order. If you have a lawn, mow it; if there are trees on the territory, cut them and take leaves away. Decorate the yard with flowers and plants, making it bright and colourful. Use sites like <a href="https://thecharmingbenchcompany.com/collections/a-l-furniture">A & L furniture website</a> to find garden furniture to show that the outdoor space is great for relaxing or entertaining. When looking for a new home, a lot of buyers ask for a functional garden area so by showing off a versatile space, you can may increase their chances of buying the house. </p>\r\n\r\nFor indoors, paint those parts of the house that have already gone old, use a <a href="https://www.bissell.com/steam-and-hard-floor-cleaners/steam-cleaners" alt="" title="">heavy steam cleanser</a> for any solid flooring and sweep the walkways to make the territory look tidy and neat. </p>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Opt for professional help</strong>\r\n\r\nThe repairing works look better and last longer if they are performed by professionals. That is the reason to <em>hire repairmen, landscape designers or a professional photographer to make your listings attractive</em>. You may spend hundreds of dollars on a high-quality paint, expensive flowers or good camera but none of your results will appeal to you and potential buyers.

Not all the people can visualize space (only 10% can do that), let alone perform more actions.

It is obvious that the objective of home staging has nothing to do with putting a blind eye on the home drawbacks. The house will be sold successfully only if it was repaired and if the improvements take place.\r\n<em>That means that every house should be prepared for the arrival of the home stager as all the possible drawbacks will be visible on the photo.</em>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]2.<strong> Failing to inform buyers what is staging and what is left in the estate </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Some people are not familiar with home staging and its possibilities to change the interior of the house significantly. They may fall in love with the <em>professional work of designers</em> and expect to see everything depicted on the picture or shown in a video in the purchased property. That is why real estate agents should always inform their clients about home staging to take place and focus on the list of things that remain in the house.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]3. <strong>No management of both consultation and staging processes </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Realtors must always share details with the stager for him to be aware of all peculiarities the home has. Discussing everything connected with staging as well as allowing a professional to present the home the way he sees it are advisable. You should trust but still control your stager.\r\nIt is obvious that staging requires time and not every expert is capable of meeting deadlines. That is why it is necessary to control the staging process as well as remind of it on a regular basis.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]4. <strong>Trying to sell property without staging </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]It happens that some clients do not realize the benefits of staging and realtors even do not try to persuade them. The fact is thatempty real estate is being sold for 90% longer than staged one. The main mistake of the realtor is avoiding making efforts to prove staging efficacy. As a result, the property can sit on the market for months and there is a necessity to lower the price to interest the potential buyers.\r\nReal estate agents should work with the sellers proving them the unsurpassed benefits of home staging: <strong>presenting home potential, getting more interest on the web and adding value to the property.</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]5. <strong>Use of low-quality photographs </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Low-quality photos have always been considered a distracting factor as nobody likes to look through them, let alone use them for more serious solutions. Some people think that poorly-looking images have been added with the purpose to hide some drawbacks. But only think how awful home staging will look like if low-quality photos were used for its background. That is another mistake made by realtors.\r\nNot every person realizes that only a high-quality image can catch the eye of the potential buyer as well as make him or her fall in love with this property. That means that photos used for home staging must be with high resolution and made with the help of professional devices like scanner or camera.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]6. <strong>Quality neglectance in pursuit of time </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Too quickly does not mean quality! Unfortunately, some realtors try to get a completed home staging process the next day after making photos. This race will hardly bring about desirable results. <strong>Premium staging services last for 2-3 weeks</strong>, so you should conduct thorough <a href="/blog/virtual-staging-marketing-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparation and planning of your marketing strategy</a> before you receive excellent staged photos.

Unless you are a professional designer knowledgeable in the <a href="/blog/virtual-staging-software-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional software</a>, your chances to create a decent product are very low.\r\nThe cost of home stager services is only a drop in the price of the property sold. That is why this responsible task should be entrusted to the expert. Even if it seems that you understand home staging services, dont be tempted with the opportunity to save some sum of money. Give this task to staging experts to receive a professional result.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]8. <strong>Telling clients to avoid using staging services </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Some realtors do not recommend using staging services being not fully aware of what it is and its benefits. Younger specialists sometimes tell their clients that the only thing they should do is to declutter. Unfortunately, it is a simple waste of money that will not bring about a desirable result.\r\nIf you hear that your agent that staging is an absolutely unnecessary thing, be sure to be misinformed. Modern buyers value quality over money. They would rather pay more for a home that reflects their personality than saving money on that. That is why a professional home presentation and marketing are of utmost importance. <strong>Remember that staging is a guarantee of more remarkable listings, higher sales rates and a bigger number of referrals.</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]9. <strong>Leaving furniture or showing photos of previous home owners </strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Opt for staging services only when the house or flat is completely empty. There should not be any remnants of the former owners. The rooms must have no furniture for them to be staged greatly. If you''re based in Australia and need help removing furniture from your home, get in toch with <a href="https://hollowaystorage.com.au/" alt="" title="">sydney storage</a> company Holloway Storage. \r\nAn idea to show the furnished room on the previous owners on the photo is also bad. When a person sees those photos he percept that as an alien home and can not imagine how he will enter or own it. That is why both old furniture and photos have nothing common with marketing techniques and influence potential buyers negatively.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]10. <strong>Taking every real estate personal or staging every room</strong>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Some realtors are not able to accept every new estate as work only. They treat it as their own property. That results in forcing home stagers to use realtors own representation of the home.\r\nAnother mistake made by realtors is staging every room. When people look for property they visualize only those rooms that will be theirs and most visited. That is why there is no sense in staging such rooms as guest ones or offices. They play a very important role in making the final choice so their staging can be omitted.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="13681" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Bedroom (before)[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][vc_single_image image="13668" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Terrace (before)[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][vc_single_image image="13683" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Living room (before)[/norebro_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="13682" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Bedroom (after)[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][vc_single_image image="13669" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Terrace (after)[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][vc_single_image image="13684" img_size="full" alignment="center"][norebro_text]Living room (after)[/norebro_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n\r\nA job of a real estate agent implies a deep <a href="/blog/virtual-staging-marketing-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge of marketing strategies</a>.

It is used to attract the potential buyers to the vacant homes. It is natural that the marketers should not make any changes to the original photos or it will be cheating. At the same time, realtors consider virtual staging a true property representation. It can make real estate both attractive and easy to recognize.\r\n\r\nRecently, the accent was made on 2D <a href="/blog/virtual-staging-software-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual staging software</a> that allowed adding furniture and looking at customary for our images. The technological boost has changed that and today it is popular to opt for 3D tools that allow realizing environment fully. Sellers offer their clients a VR headset wearing which they can move around the estate and see how you can spare furnishing beneficially. 3D photographs that are further staged are made with the help of a 3D scanner.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing guaranteed by VR to marketers is an opportunity to conduct remote tours as well as adjust any details during the tour. It eases the job of real estate agents as well as helps them to identify clients with serious intentions. For example, if a person is trying to fit his furniture into the room, that means that his intention to buy the estate is serious.\r\n\r\nThe cost of VR differs from the list of services offered. It may vary between $300 and $700 as you might need to scan the room with the help of VR camera, set up the program etc. Bigger commercial companies may charge much more for the same package of services.[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_heading module_type_layout="on_left" subtitle_type_layout="without_subtitle" title="SG93JTIwdG8lMjBnZXQlMjB0aGUlMjBtb3N0JTIwb2YlMjB0aGUlMjB2aXJ0dWFsJTIwc3RhZ2luZw==" title_color="#f3b435"][vc_empty_space height="25px"][norebro_text]Virtual staging may attract more leads and transform them into regular customers.

It is the place where family members gather each day and where they host and entertain their guests. It also includes lots of decor elements that form an impression about property owners, one way or another living room displays their character.</li>\r\n 	<li>Kitchen. Some people believe that kitchen is the heart of every home. In this room, we take care of our nearest and dearest cooking meals that fill our bodies and then minds. Potential buyers often want it to be convenient, functional and well-designed and are interested in optimal solutions in its furnishing and decor. In these regards, virtual staging for realtors can be really helpful.</li>\r\n 	<li>Master bedroom. Certainly, pictures of this room should be associated with comfort, relax and ease, so your buyer will be so much happy to see the big comfortable bed on it as well as reasonable furniture placement and sweet decorations.

With staging services performed, you may never believe that one or another empty room could have ever looked like that. Of course, home staging has similar possibilities in transforming the property look, but the cost of both these services differs greatly.

It goes without saying that the staging is performed by professional designers and architects who make all the measurements and the interior plan to make every photo completed and appealing. A designer starts using <a href="https://www.spotlessagency.com/">virtual staging</a> software only when the interior is considered to the smallest details. He looks for suitable pieces, adjusts their size, places them in the image, works with light and shades etc. It is a painstaking and thorough process that requires time and dedication. Moreover, virtual stagers usually use not a single program to achieve a desirable effect. There are multiple software programs but there are no universal examples among them.

It is important to measure all the room to get exact data and draw its sketch on the paper. It will allow you to distribute pieces of furniture around the room for a real arrangement to fit the room size. You can also do that not on the sheet of paper but using modern computer software and tools.</li>\r\n 	<li>Decide what will be a focal point of the room\r\nEvery room should have a thing that will attract more attention than other pieces - it is called a focal point. In most cases it can be a fireplace, television, chandelier or picture. All the other furniture should contribute to the look of the focal point. The last one should be scaled properly to fit the room size and avoid looking odd. There is a general rule according to which you should have at least 3 feet of empty space around each object in the room.</li>\r\n 	<li>Make the furniture arrangement open\r\nRemember that all the pieces of furniture should as if welcome you in the room. It means that when you open the door, the should not be put directly with their back to you - it create an impression of an obstacle. Of course, it is impossible to locate every piece facing the door, but none of them should meet a person with its back.</li>\r\n 	<li>Get enough surfaces\r\nNo matter whether it is a living room, bedroom or nursery there should be furniture pieces with the surface within arms reach. You will always have anything to put on it so these surfaces should be considered thoroughly. In the living room, it can be a coffee table, while in the bedroom this role belongs to bedside tables mainly. One more thing to consider is the level of this surface regarding other furniture pieces - it must be close.</li>\r\n 	<li>Think about movement around the room\r\nOf course, it is possible to stage a room with furniture very thoroughly, but will you achieve the goals set then? It is natural that every room will once be visited and there should be enough space to move around it. If a room has several entrances, they must be connected with a pathway between each other and have no obstacles on the way. You should provide easy access to every furniture item.</li>\r\n 	<li>Always use accessories\r\nEven a furnished room looks faceless without accessories. Simple curtains play such a significant role in making a room cozier, let alone other great decorative items. Remember about pictures, rugs, flowers, souvenirs and, of course, mirrors. Their strategically right positioning will make a great contribution to the well-built interior.</li>\r\n 	<li>Opt for symmetry in the room\r\nSymmetric interiors are more appealing and preferred by people. They have a completed look and create a special atmosphere in the room.</li>\r\n 	<li>Lighting\r\nAny luxurious furniture will look not impressive unless you consider lighting in the room. Dark areas, shades and different finish palette are only some of the challenges to cope with. It is preferable to get a mix of overhead lighting unless a chandelier is your focal point in the room. Another thing to consider is to fill the room with lighting placed at different levels to create a balance in the room.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n[/norebro_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_empty_space height="20px"][norebro_gallery show_title="1" metro_style="1" columns="2-2-1-1" content_images="14497,14498"][vc_empty_space height="40px"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][norebro_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture staging is one of the most challenging tasks when you work with an empty room.

It is a process of building, constructing, connecting pieces. Modeling reminds a work of a sculptor or carpenter who uses GPU as the main tool for creating his masterpiece.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rendering is the process of turning a model into an image, video or animation, providing it with new effects and placing it into the realistic setting.

Modeling is one of the initial stages of the visualization process. You need to create the main ‘hero’ of your final project with the consideration of the smallest details. It is the act of making a model that would be subjected to different effects during the rendering process. The last one is regarded to be one of the final stages of the workflow. It includes adding such effects as lighting, orientation, backgrounds, animations etc. The main goal of the renderer is to transform virtual bits into a photorealistic output in different forms (images, videos, animations etc.). One more difference between these two notions are purposes set for them. 3D modeling is used for:</span>[/norebro_text][norebro_text]</p>\r\n<ul class="ul-brand">\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling improved project planning;</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing any exist in interferences among building systems;</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing a schematic structure of the future object;</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eliminating conflicts before system installation.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>[/norebro_text][norebro_text]</p>\r\n<p style="font-weight: 400;">The main goals of 3D rendering are more general:</p>\r\n<ul class="ul-brand">\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling improved design-related decisions;</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating marketing, presentation and design analysis;</span></li>\r\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Displaying ideas in various forms.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>[/norebro_text][norebro_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both these processes depend on each other. There is no sense in creating a background if you do not have a focal point of your project - the main one or several models. Vice versa, the model looks raw and unfinished without a quality rendering process, so both these notions are interdependent. However, when you turn to the company in search of quality 3D services, you need to understand if you need a fully developed project with rendering or just a creation of the model that will be used further for other purposes.</span>[/norebro_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]</p>\r\n', 'Difference between 3D modeling and rendering', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'difference-between-3d-modeling-and-rendering', '', '', '2018-07-18 11:29:38', '2018-07-18 09:29:38', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15094', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Without it, the room looks empty and faceless, so its choice is a very responsible task. Furniture manufacturers understand this fact too and do everything possible to offer the most accurate and perfectly measured furniture renderings to their customers. Unlike photos, they give an accurate understanding of the color, size, measurements and sometimes can be used in the interior design software to see how it fits the wholesome room design. For example, you may decide on a new rug for your living room but after considering the measurements and color of it, you decide that it''s best to go with another option.

Many people who are going to sell their property for more money take advantage of home staging - the process of making a home more appealing to the potential buyers using some hints and techniques. However, modern staging is divided into two types: actual and virtual one. The first one is dedicated to the use of real furniture pieces and decor in the creation of a home interior design. Virtual staging is used to make listings of the empty property more appealing and sell the home faster rather than for a bigger price. In both cases, a young professional who wants to take up this sphere as his career must consider several pieces of advice mentioned below to achieve success.</span>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="15px"][vc_single_image source="external_link" custom_src="/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/6.jpg"][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]\r\n<ol class="ol-brand">\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not enough to be passionate</span>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creativity and passion are good features for developing business but it is not enough to possess them to make it sustainable. Of course, these features will help you to look outstanding and offer something new to your clients at the very beginning, but with time you will need to look for other benefits you can give to the clients. A successful business should have an accurate direction and several ways to achieve the purpose. Business is a constant work that might gradually kill your passion for interior design, but a necessity to complete orders will remain. The only consequence you can make out of this passage is the fact that it is easy to start a staging business, but many startups cease their work very quickly.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This business is not taught and does not encourage friendship</span>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitiveness is a feature of every business so you will hardly find experts who will share their secrets on how to make staging business successful. The biggest part of staging courses gives only basics of design and focuses on logistics, marketing and skills required. The main reason for that is a possibility to provide virtual staging services from any corner of the world.

You need to wait for some time and put much effort for your staging business to bring about profit. Be ready to work for long hours and spend more time on developing your business rather than home staging process itself. Most of the clients wish to get excellent photos right now to market them tomorrow already and nobody cares how you feel or how much work you have.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always work to do even without current orders</span>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Performing orders will take only the third part of your working schedule as most of your time will be spent on planning, attracting new professionals, promoting, controlling etc. If you plan to complete all the orders yourself, this business will be hardly successful. Every company should grow and develop so never stand in one place and hire people to perform the routine responsibilities like staging.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare yourself for criticism</span>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, only a small percentage of clients is satisfied with the image or design received. Many of them are very emotional as they are going to sell their property for big money and still doubt if they manage to do that or because of many other reasons as well. Consequently, when you take the order from a client, specify his wishes up to the smallest details to prevent yourself from further revisions and severe criticism.</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up a well-written contract to secure yourself</span>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it is reasonable to prepare a contract for big orders and list all the details mentioned in the previous paragraph there.

It creates an impression that a room has a designer interior, looks more attractive and gives the understanding how spacious it is and what fits it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actual or home staging is the same process of creating a beautiful interior by a hired designer to show how comfortable and good this place can be.

However, its great efficiency has been appreciated only several years ago. Nowadays many realtors agree that virtual staging is a necessity in the real estate market because only 10% of all people can see the potential of the empty property without visualization techniques. All the rest need help in this tough task and virtual staging can be a way out in this situation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there is a thought that virtual staging serves as an attraction to the potential buyers who have to get disappointed when they turn up at the showings of a vacant home. As a result, people refuse to buy a property that does not correspond to the listings, even if they were warned about that. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One more controversy connected with virtual staging lies in the question: can it substitute real staging fully? Today it is used as an alternative to home staging. Its main purpose is to make listings more appealing to the viewers and show how this empty space can be used with benefit. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that actual staging takes place when one of the goals is to make beautiful listing photos. However, it is not the main purpose of this process. People order real staging services to increase the cost of the property for sale. Unfortunately, virtual staging can not cope with this task. At the same time, it is important to remember that virtual staging costs almost ten times cheaper than an actual one. Here you can ask a question: is it reasonable to invest several thousand dollars in home staging and how much can it increase the cost of the property?</span>[/norebro_text][norebro_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a homeowner does not have this money or realizes that real staging will not help him to sell the property for a bigger price, but he understands that it must be sold faster, the only right solution in this situation is to order quality virtual staging services.

It is a widely known fact that actual or real staging costs a bomb. You need to spend from several hundred to several thousand dollars to stage your home fully. There is no sense in doing that partially as the effect of an empty faceless space will undoubtedly push the buyers away. With virtual staging figures are much more promising and affordable. If to analyze the offer of the most reputable virtual staging companies working on the US market, you will see that numbers differ. You can order a staged photo for the price of the minimum $49 and it can rise up $200. Of course, this cost depends on several circumstances:</span>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="15px"][norebro_text]\r\n<ul class="ul-brand">\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company reputation that performs the order;</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realism and quality characteristics;</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number of revisions (they are often unlimited);</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turnaround time for every photo and the project as a whole;</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number of services offered (furniture staging, replacement, adding, decorating etc.)</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="15px"][vc_single_image source="external_link" custom_src="/wp-content/uploads/blogimg/qw_2.jpg"][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that the more photos you order, the bigger discount you will get.

You may wonder how this can help with selling? In fact, the first thing the biggest number of buyers pay attention to is photos and only then price.

Consequently, a buyer has all the chances to implement this design in the new empty home.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has always been a challenge for realtors to sell the property that stuck in the listings for the original price and not decrease it. That is why modern real estate agencies recommend sellers who plan to show photos of the empty property in the listings never do that. It is more reasonable to order virtual staging services before you add your property to the listings. The statistics mention that staged homes are sold by 40% faster than empty ones. As a result, you get more chances to sell the property for the price set and prevent yourself from wait in for months or even years.</span>[/norebro_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]', 'Virtual staging helps to sell property stuck in the market', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'virtual-staging-helps-to-sell-property-stuck-in-the-market', '', '', '2018-08-23 09:36:12', '2018-08-23 13:36:12', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15277', 0, 'post', '', 0);

If this home is sold furnished, it is very important to hire a photographer and take beautiful professional photos that will attract hundreds of viewers. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are homes that are furnished partially or sold empty and it is impossible to make their photos appealing to others. Furniture and decor give a presentation of the room size and potential, while the photos of bare walls seem dull, faceless and decrease the real size of the room visually. It means that adding photos of an empty home you minimize the chances of your home to appeal to others yourself. As a result, it looks non-competitive next to other ads and remains in the listings for long months. But there is also a big chance to attract viewers’ attention to an empty property and make it much more appealing from the very beginning. In this situation, you need to try virtual staging - adding both furniture and decorative items to the photos of a vacant home. This approach will not only make the rooms cozy and welcoming but also give a presentation of their size thanks to the furniture arrangement. As a result, you get perfectly designed rooms with a modern depersonalized interior that will appeal to a majority of the potential buyers. As a result, your chances to sell a home faster fly sky-high and you will not have to make discounts - be sure to have a tough competition for your home. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes virtually staged photos are made so professionally, that people fall in love with the property and even ready to pay more to get it.</span>[/norebro_text][vc_empty_space height="15px"][vc_raw_html]JTNDZGl2JTIwJTIwY2xhc3MlM0QlMjd0d2VudHl0d2VudHktY29udGFpbmVyJTIwdHdlbnR5dHdlbnR5LWN1c3RvbSUyNyUzRSUwQSUyMCUyMCUyMCUyMCUzQ2ltZyUyMHNyYyUzRCUyNyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGYmxvZ2ltZyUyRjQuMS5qcGclMjclMjBhbHQlM0QlMjJwcm9wZXJ0eSUyMGJlZm9yZSUyMiUzRSUwQSUyMCUyMCUyMCUyMCUzQ2ltZyUyMHNyYyUzRCUyNyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGYmxvZ2ltZyUyRjQuMi5qcGclMjclMjBhbHQlM0QlMjJwcm9wZXJ0eSUyMGFmdGVyJTIyJTNFJTBBJTNDJTJGZGl2JTNF[/vc_raw_html][vc_empty_space height="40px"][norebro_text]<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, virtual staging is a cost-effective solution for vacant homes in comparison to home staging.

Every property might have minor or huge drawbacks and virtual staging must not be a goal to hide it. If there are any cracks, damages or a bad view from the window, it would be unfair to cover it fully using virtual furniture pieces or thick curtains.

Many experts agree that virtually staged homes do not show the reality and serve as a chance to attract clients in an unjust way. However, every staging company warns its clients to mention in every listing that contains virtually staged photos about this fact for people not to be disappointed on showing. Most of the people come to a vacant home with the staged images in the hands to compare and leave the property satisfied as these photos can be implemented in reality without much effort.

It will help to determine some negative features that require improvement. Even such little effort may influence the total price of your property, so consider the following:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->\r\n<ol><li><strong>Living room</strong></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It is natural that a living room is one of the most important rooms in a home since it is used for gathering guests and plays a very important role in creating an impression about the entire home. The main trouble of most homes is the lack of light in the living room. Sometimes it is not enough to open the curtains and let sunlight in, so experts advise adding more light to the room by installing a skylight, for example. It will become much more appealing to potential buyers. Alternatively, you could consider adding new <a href="https://onlinedoorstore.co.uk">Internal Doors</a> to your living room. It might be worth looking at glazed doors if you have a problem with the light in that room. They allow sunlight to flow into the room, adding some additional light and brightening the room up significantly.  </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>2.<strong> More open space</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Modern interior trends are focused mostly on wide open spaces, so if you have a home with many small rooms, it is time to tear down several walls. Now, people are not looking for a bigger number of rooms - they pay more attention to functionality rather than a number. Consequently, if you make your home more meaningful, it will be appreciated by a bigger number of buyers and impact its value too.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>3. <strong>Bathroom</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Despite being a room with one of the smallest areas, its importance should not be underestimated. A bathroom can be called a face of the home since it opens many secrets about the way the home is built, how it was maintained, and what potential problems future owners may have. It is very important not only to make the bathroom interior adorable with additions such as luxurious <a href="https://glassshowerdirect.com" alt="" title="">shower glass</a> and more, but also inspect it for the presence of any problems (drains, plumbing issues, condition of pipes used etc.). It can be hard to know what sort of plumbing problems that you need to look out for, especially if you don''t have any knowledge in this area to begin with. The best option in this circumstance would be for you to consider getting in touch with a local plumbing service in your area. It could be one that is similar to this Silverwater Plumbing company, (<a href="https://www.silverwaterplumbing.com.au/plumber-blacktown/">https://www.silverwaterplumbing.com.au/plumber-blacktown/</a>) so you can get a professional insight into any problems that may need resolving before you decide to put your home on the market, as no one will want to buy your home if it has plumbing issues. Correction of these problems as well as adding some modern features like water-saving technology, using sensors to activate the water, or making a bathroom more eco-friendly can be convincing factors for making the price higher.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>4. <strong>Yard and curb appeal</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It has been mentioned many times that the first impression is the most memorable one. Even if your home looks excellent inside but you did not find time to keep order in the yard and improve its appearance, the chances to get the desirable price may vanish forever. It is of utmost importance to keep the yard clean, let alone make it look well-maintained and beautiful. Another important tip is paying attention to the way your home looks outside. You should refresh the paint, fix some issues, remove debris, and make everything for its outer look to be as inviting as inside one. Whilst all of this can seem like a hassle, it will improve the curb appeal significantly. However, to save yourself time, it might be worth looking into siding for your home instead. This can enhance the appearance of your home significantly, whilst also protecting it from extreme weather events. To look into <a href="https://lifetimewindowscolorado.com/fiber-cement-siding/">James Hardie Siding</a>, it might be worth researching online to see a selection of colors and materials to improve the curb appeal. \r\n  </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>5. <strong>Be reasonable</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It goes without saying that every homeowner wishes to sell his property faster and for bigger money.

Neglecting their advice may lead to poor consequences and termination of the sale. However, you make a much bigger mistake if you refuse to show your home at the time comfortable for a client. Sometimes, people have no opportunity to turn up at those two hours you have found in your schedule for this purpose.

A good real estate agent not only looks through the Multiple Listing Service but also learn all the details connected with this property, makes pre-inspections before adding it to the ones to offer a client, learns about the neighborhood and facilities etc. The main benefit of hiring a professional is the fact that a home for sale will be inspected by an experienced person who will immediately spot any issues and prevent you from making a big mistake or ask for a discount.

It requires mowing, removing debris, weeds, and adorning of with fresh pot plants. During the fall, having autumnal leaves scattered across your yard can present a messy and careless look. Looking into <a href="https://thebestleafblowers.com/">The Best Leaf Blowers</a> depletes the mess and has your yard looking as fresh as it did in summer. Having fencing also puts your home in high regard, as many homeowners appreciate their privacy in their outdoor living space or need to be assured of no room for the escape of pets if they have any. Stylish and modern fencing puts a unique and sleek spin on your home that intrigues potential buyers. If you don''t already have fencing, you can <a href="https://www.ecompositeproducts.co.uk/ecomposite-fencing-products/composite-fencing/">install a striking garden feature</a> easily upon looking online.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When you finish your outdoor cleaning, it is time to enter your home. It is important to pay special attention to the carpets, remove mold from the grout and make tiles shine, as well as put effort to scrub windows too. If you leave old furnishing, it is important to improve its look by renovation and cleaning it. Another piece of advice is removing any evidence of the pet presence since it often discourages people who are not fond of pets. Sometimes it might be essential to replace some older items in your home, to make your house appear more modern. The less work a buyer has to do to the home, the more chance you have of them liking it. Often bathrooms can look run down if they haven''t been updated in a while, you could consider giving your bathroom a slight makeover and replacing your old shower with a new, modern one. This might appeal to buyers who don''t want to completely renovate their home as soon as they move in, you could always search the internet to find out <a href="https://buyersimpact.co.uk/reviews/best-electric-shower/">what''s the best electric shower</a> for modern bathroom designs.

Declutter</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Presence of any personal or old things push back the potential buyers who can not treat this property as their own. Let''s analyze what decluttering is in details. First of all, it is hiding or taking away any personal things such as photographs, hand-made decor, perfumes, cosmetics etc. It is necessary to check every room of your home. When you enter a kitchen, there should not be any dishware and appliances. Any towels, shampoo, hair brushes, toothbrushes must be removed from the bathroom. If possible, remove most of your clothes from built-in storage spaces and wardrobes too. If you have any tools, empty flower pots or toys of your children, it is preferable to take them away too. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>3. Rearrange</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As soon as you remove unwanted items, it is time to create a new atmosphere of the home. Remember that every room must have its face and character to be easily identified with a certain type. Try to decorate every room of your house separately. Switch on the fireplace and set your dining table in the living room, add general decor such as flowers, pillows, candles, fresh towels in the bathroom and bedroom etc. Avoid overcrowded spaces with too many furniture pieces - it is better to prefer a minimum of furnishing and neutral colors. Any fresh flowers will look excellent outside. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>4. Prepare for a Showtime</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Showing property for sale can be compared with demonstrating your new dress at the ball. It is a very responsible day and everything must be perfect on it. For this purpose, you need to put a bit more effort directly on this day. Before the potential buyers turn up at your home, try to show off its best features. You need to make final cleaning solutions and hide any hints of having a pet. Light creates a special atmosphere, so do not forget to let it into your home opening curtains and switching on the light. Remember that a carefully made up bed and fluffy cushions look very appealing, while fresh flowers in a vase draw attention not only with their look but also fresh smell. Tasty tea and cookies will provide another bunch of positive emotions, so prepare them in advance.<br></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Cost-effective staging solutions to sell home fast', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'cost-effective-staging-solutions-to-sell-home-fast', '', '', '2019-06-14 07:18:18', '2019-06-14 11:18:18', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15434', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Moreover, since their job involves moving around the neighborhood, city, or even a state, the car seems to be a necessity rather than a<strong> luxury</strong>. However, there is a question: should real estate agents drive expensive cars or C class is enough? One of the groups on Facebook raised this question because of the message of<strong> realtor</strong> Andrea Hatton. Her former customer sent her an email where he refused to use her services again because her ‘car was too dumpy''. You may wonder what car she was driving - Honda Accord 2007.  The participants of the discussion on Facebook decided to come to the conclusion of whether flashy cars are suitable for real estate agents. A necessity to cover hundreds of miles on a daily basis without a car is a real challenge, so every realtor tries to buy a car as fast as possible. Moreover, the car possessed by real estate agents influences the way clients perceive them, so it is very important to choose the right model. This means that some real estate agents will have expensive cars shipping in, using a service similar to <a href="https://carsrelo.com/what-we-ship/car/">Cars Relo</a> so their customers will be satisfied.  There is a viewpoint that flashy cars contribute to the success of the deal. The others suppose that showing off prosperity may lead to alienation and even a desire to get a bigger discount.  One of the group members who consider driving expensive cars a benefit explains that real estate business is oriented on image and not only regarding the property, so a good car can serve as an attraction. One broker in Atlanta suggested another opinion paying more attention to the quality of services provided rather than accessories used. He believes that clients enjoy cooperating with successful real estate agents but their commission should not be sky-high too. He also mentioned his friend working in Atlanta and driving luxurious Ferrari, whose commission is not high but the total amount of money he sold for was $143 million. There are agents who admit being explicitly evaluated on the basis of cars they drive. It is especially noticeable in such places as Miami or San Francisco where a vehicle says about your success in the industry.   According to Hector Chinea, he knows buyers who refused from the services of some agents because of their scrubby look.  However, there is another side of the medal too. There were cases discussed when driving a high-class car led people to wrong consequences. They think that such realtors have bigger commissions and try to get a discount from them.  One lady even mentioned the fact that it is really painful each time to see a realtor who has sold your home for debts driving a Mercedes.  According to Brendan Clemmens, the car driven by realtor may have two opposite impacts on clients. Ones may believe that <strong>real estate agents</strong> earn too much and ask for a reduction, while others can evaluate this fact as a feature of success in the industry and hire a realtor without any doubts. That is why many realtors have come to the conclusion that the best car is one to reflect success without smacking anyone over the head.  One more reasonable solution was made on the point that the best car for a real estate agent will differ depending on the market he or she works on and what clients are to be attracted in this way. <strong>Realtors</strong> who sell luxurious property can afford to buy more expensive cars while dealing with urban areas and small property should be reflected in a middle-class segment of cars. It would not be strange to see Bentley in Los Angeles or San Diego, but if such a vehicle will be parked next to a wooden home somewhere in the middle of Nevada, it may lead to several questions. One more point discussed by realtors is the importance of buying cars made in America. There were cases when realtors had lost pricey listings because they were not driving domestic cars.  However, there are people who believe that the car driven by realtor does not have any impact on clients at all. Some realtors admit not caring their clients'' attitude to the car they drive paying attention to their own comfort and choice.  Some users even suggested cases when real estate agents on cheap cars have closed big deals without much effort and a car did not interfere with the deal at all.  But the main conclusion to the discussion was made by Lori Winterhalter. She stated that it is not the car that matters, it is the attitude to the clients that plays the main role in the success of the deal.  <br></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Fancy cars for real estate agents: Yes or No?', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'fancy-cars-for-real-estate-agents-yes-or-no', '', '', '2019-12-19 06:52:14', '2019-12-19 10:52:14', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15448', 0, 'post', '', 0);

That is why there are over 2 million realtors in the US only and many people want to try this profession and achieve success in it. However, when you enter the market, you may face a real challenge - how to find the first clients. Experienced realtors and brokers do have multiple tools and approaches but not all of them are suitable for newbies in this profession.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody knows the secret of starting a successful career in the real estate business. However, there is nothing unbelievable in the formula of success too. The generation of consistent business in real estate depends on how actively you ask for referrals and it is a key to success. \n\nWho to choose?\nIt goes without saying that somebody from your relatives, friends or colleagues is planning a move or purchase of property in the closest future. Even if not, these people have friends and co-workers who are in search of a real estate agent. Surveys prove that 45% of millennials turn to their friends for recommendations and you may be one to be suggested.\nIt is also worth noting that we live in the era of technology so people tend to read reviews and testimonials online, so always ask your satisfied clients to write at least a couple of words about your services. \n\n3 ways to attract clients for newbie agents\nEvery person who starts working in the sphere of services is looking forward to getting the first clients, however, it may take ages to find one if you do not put effort. If you are a new agent, there is hardly anyone to know about you, so there are little chances that the first client will turn up in your office himself. That is why it is necessary to consider the following three tips to get your first client faster.\n\n1. Turn to your family members and friends. All of them know what a person you are and whether you deserve their trust. Undoubtedly, they will do their best to help you so that you could achieve success in this business. Inform them about your license and your desire to find clients - buyers, sellers, renters - to build a basement for your business. Tell them that you will put much effort to satisfy them and try to make only a good impression. Be sure, they will help you!\n\n\n2. Continue asking! There are clients who are not satisfied with the agent they have hired and they look for the services of another person. If someone knows such people, ask for their contacts and suggest your services. If you manage to deserve their trust and leave them pleased with your work, your referral will be sent to a much bigger circle of people, who may once become your potential clients. What is required from you is being persistent and perform your responsibilities well.\n\n3. Don’t hesitate to show your gratitude. The desire of your friends and family to help you is great and you should appreciate it. Even if they managed to assist you to the minimum degree, don’t doubt to thank them or send a card with the words of gratitude. They should know that efforts they put to the development of your real estate business are appreciated and it will encourage them to be more active in referrals too. \n\n\nEvery business faces many challenges at the very beginning. Real estate agents are not an exception. It may be a real challenge to create a circle of clients because not everyone agrees to work with a new agent. However, it is important to remember that you are educated and licensed professional who can perform responsibilities well. Don’t give up if you face any obstacles on your way to success! Continue your way to success and you will see that everything is possible if you do wish that.\n\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'How to attract the first real estate clients', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'how-to-attract-the-first-real-estate-clients', '', '', '2019-07-10 07:40:11', '2019-07-10 11:40:11', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15456', 0, 'post', '', 0);

This saying has confirmed its truth for centuries and is still actual. It is impossible to reach anything without hard work. Real estate industry is often connected with working overtime, at late hours or on weekends. Otherwise, there is no sense to hope for success. \nHonesty\nOnly being honest it is possible to deserve the trust of other people. Sometimes there is a great desire to hide anything and close the deal faster, but if a real estate agent does that, his or her career may crash. Over 70% of real estate clients hire realtors by recommendation. Who will recommend you if you cheat people? It is more reasonable to follow high ethical standards and appreciate what you have than lose everything. \nSelf-motivation\nIt often happens that real estate agents are bosses for themselves, so every realtor should set realistic goals and timeframes to achieve them. Otherwise, there will be no development and professional growth.\nSolution of problems\nReal estate business sets numerous challenges for realtors and their clients, so every deal requires a real estate agent to solve multiple problems of different types. It means that without this trait of character, a realtor will not survive in this industry.\n<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', '10 Traits of character for a successful realtor', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', '10-traits-of-character-for-a-successful-realtor', '', '', '2019-07-24 07:30:01', '2019-07-24 11:30:01', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15460', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Every market has its own hot time, and if in one city, it can be easier to build your career in this industry, another city or town can be a real hell for new and even experienced real estate agents.  How to choose a city to work as a realtor in When you decide to begin a real estate career and want to achieve success in it, it is very important to choose the right city for a start. Every city has its own market but it is preferable to choose the area you are knowledgeable about. Otherwise, you will have to spend weeks to get around. Moreover, there are cities which are more advantageous for building a career in real estate and ones where it is impossible even to earn your living since the percentage of sales and rent is incredibly low. SmartAssets platform has conducted a study to understand which cities are the best ones for building a career in real estate. For this purpose, researchers have analyzed American cities according to four factors including: Home turnover rate (the percentage of homes sold for one year); Annual changes in the median sale price; Competition (number of homes sold per every agent); Median compensation received by a real estate agent. Experts also advise considering several more factors when you select a city to work in. Bigger metropolises which attract employees are great if you specialize in rent. The consideration of the moving statistics will help to understand the trends where people relocate most often - these cities will also have more property sales and rents. However, it is important to remember that legislation also impacts estate sales too since more business-friendly cities attract a bigger percentage of investment too.  Rating of the best cities The results of the study mentioned above are quite predictable. These are cities with a quite extensive job market as well as major tech centers. Some of the leaders are places where the cost of living is more affordable, while the others are ranked the highest in net migration.  Having conducted a study with the analysis of four different factors mentioned above, the researchers suggested the following rating.  Top 10 cities for building a successful real estate career looks as follows in 2019 (data is taken on Zillow):</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->\n<ol><li> Las Vegas, Nevada Number of homes for sale: 10,198 Median home price: $274,700 Number of flats to rent: 1,972 Median rent price: $1500 </li><li> Reno, Nevada Number of homes for sale: 1,977 Median home price: $371,200 Number of flats to rent: 374 Median rent price: $1,720 </li><li> Rockford, Illinois Number of homes for sale: 1,098 Median home price: $86,400 Number of flats to rent: 201 Median rent price: $950 </li><li>  Eugene, Oregon Number of homes for sale: 638 Median home price: $313,500 Number of flats to rent: 125 Median rent price: $1,595 </li><li> Naples, Florida Number of homes for sale: 7,160 Median home price: $319,200 Number of flats to rent: 0 Median rent price: $3,500 </li><li> Sacramento, California Number of homes for sale: 1,646 Median home price: $327,200 Number of flats to rent: 528 Median rent price: $1,750 </li><li>  San Jose, California Number of homes for sale: 1,535 Median home price: $1,022,300 Number of flats to rent: 987 Median rent price: $3,500 </li><li> Denver, Colorado Number of homes for sale: 2,901 Median home price: $422,400 Number of flats to rent: 1,991 Median rent price: $2,200 </li><li> Chicago, Illinois Number of homes for sale: 15,248 Median home price: $228,00 Number of flats to rent: 10,930 Median rent price: $1,800 </li><li>  New York, New York Number of homes for sale: 33,704 Median home price: $676,00 Number of flats to rent: 12,613 Median rent price: $2,900 <br> </li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', '10 Cities for making a real estate career in 2019', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', '10-cities-for-making-a-real-estate-career-in-2019', '', '', '2019-08-02 08:05:39', '2019-08-02 12:05:39', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15465', 0, 'post', '', 0);

The holiday season is usually a difficult period for real estate agents since the number of deals, as well as buyers and sellers, decreases greatly. The reason for that is people’s desire to take a vacation, celebrate and just rest. It is also the time when realtors have time to take a break and gather all their strengths for the upcoming season. However, if you are not going to rest in the holiday season and want to continue working, these simple tips will help you to survive it more successfully.\nLet everyone know about your availability\nLike all other people many realtors prefer to rest on holidays, but if you decide to work, don’t forget to inform your clients about it. How can you do that? Continue your previous efforts to attract leads by sending out emails, posting new content to the website and social network accounts, and mentioning there about your availability. Connect your posts with holidays and offer incentives connected with this time of the year too. Even if you have no sales, you will continue to attract leads.\nRemind your leads and clients about less competition in the market\nLate fall and winter is the time when the real estate market is in a lull, so there is no severe competition for the best offers. Your clients might be not aware of this fact, so it is very important to remind them about this opportunity. If they were thinking of buying a house, there is hardly any better time for a purchase. You can send emails which will focus on the benefits of buying homes in winter and provide facts and numbers to sound convincing. \nCongratulate your clients on the upcoming holidays\nIt is always pleasant to receive greetings on holidays, but for real estate agents, it is also the opportunity to remind about themselves. Sending holiday greetings may secure referrals from them since even if they do not plan to sell or buy property, they can recommend real estate agent services to another person and generate leads in this way. People who are thinking of buying an estate will be encouraged to call an agent faster too. \nContinue building your real estate business network\nThe fact that the real estate market is getting slower in winter should not prevent you from building your clients’ network. Since there is more free time in this period you have more opportunities to visit more events related to real estate business and make new acquaintances. It is also a good time to drink a cup of coffee with your leads and ask about their plans too.\nContact real estate investors\nThere are people who look for good investment property no matter what season it is behind the window. If you have a couple or at least one variant for a successful investment, don’t lose a chance to inform your clients about it.  \nSpend time on improving your real estate business\nHoliday time brings about more free time and real estate agents who are not planning to rest long can take advantage of it. It is never late to improve your real estate business by improving your marketing strategy, working on lead generation, learning about new approaches and technologies in this business. This effort will bring about desirable results and you will be able to spend your next year holidays as a successful real estate professional. \n\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', '6 Tips for realtor how to survive a holiday season', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', '6-tips-for-realtor-how-to-survive-a-holiday-season', '', '', '2019-08-05 06:53:11', '2019-08-05 10:53:11', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15471', 0, 'post', '', 0);

In fact, it is a goal of every newbie realtor to become once a top real estate agent and they''ll often start off by referring to colleagues as well as resources such as this <a href="https://inboundrem.com/real-estate-prospecting/">InboundREM Real Estate Prospecting tutorial</a> and similar guides. At the same time, top realtors behave and act in a different way from their colleagues. Having reached some success in this industry they change their strategies and start acting in a different way. What exactly changes? Look through 8 things top real estate agent do that others don''t. Never stop marketing Some young realtors believe that when they find a big number of potential clients they can stop their marketing strategy for some time. However, it is a mistake to believe that you can once stop generating leads. Any big pause will immediately reflect on your income and the future of your business. Top realtors even if they deal with sales or closing deals never refuse from generating leads. It is very important to pay 1 or 2 hours a day to this activity but there is no need to devote all your time to this task too. Experienced realtors block some time every day to promote themselves and attract clients and that is enough to be on the flow.  Make a focus on listings. One more great mistake made by inexperienced agents is paying more attention to buyers than sellers - companies like <a href="https://www.getagent.co.uk/">Get Agent</a> flip this on its head by tailoring the process to those looking to sell their home. Even if you work overtime but most of your clients are buyers, it will not bring about that revenue you hope for. Top agents devote a good deal of their time to the listings to generate more leads in this way. When you manage to find sellers, you will see that the number of buyers has increased too. Build a base of referrals Both new and experienced realtors should pay much attention to building a network of their clients. If a person starts his or her real estate career, the first thing they should do is to gather everyone they know, take their contact information, and contact them regularly to stay in touch. The process of building such a referral base must be incessant and the more contacts of the person you have, the better. Opt for prospecting Real estate agents have to be intrusive if they want to achieve success in their business. The highest conversion rates are possessed by realtors who are not afraid to contact for-sale-by-owners listings and convince them to use their services. Most of the sellers wish to complete the sale as fast as possible and the cooperation with realtors may help them greatly.  Make use of real estate scripts There are many scripts which have been tested by thousands of realtors and proven their effectiveness. Top managers never neglect using them when they communicate with their clients and what is most interesting, they do work. Work and generate leads simultaneously. No matter what you are busy with at the moment, generating leads must be your priority whatever you do, even just making sure to check out <a href="https://www.vulcan7.com/">expired leads</a> will also help you. You may call the listings or visiting neighbors of the home for sale, but it is important not to forget asking others if they know anyone who wants to buy or sell the property. You should contribute to your business development from different sides, so always try to get benefit from any activity. Share your responsibilities When an agent comes to the conclusion that he or she does not have enough time for prospecting new business, it means it is time to ask for help. The best way out of this situation is to hire an assistant who will share a good deal of your work. Most often, this time comes when the annual sales volume reaches from $6 to $10 million.  </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', '7 Things done by top real estate agents', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', '7-things-done-by-top-real-estate-agents', '', '', '2019-08-09 05:21:28', '2019-08-09 09:21:28', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15476', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Any break in the activity may result in a smaller number of leads and a possibility to miss a good deal. That is why they prefer to work all year round and forget about holidays and vacations. If real estate agents who work in the companies have scheduled vacations, independent contractors and entrepreneurs should decide that themselves. Considering a vacation a real luxury they can devote time to it only when there is enough money but such a moment almost never comes. They usually postpone it for better times and they come very rarely.  If you are one of those who cannot find time for a vacation but realize the importance of good rest, learn these 3 strategies and never neglect this time. Plan it All real estate agents make a plan for the upcoming year and one of the points to include in it is a vacation. Every person requires time to disconnect from work and daily routine, so it is enough to make an intention to have a rest and you will get what you want. If you schedule your vacation, you will surely wait for it and make plans. You need to set a date of your vacation and not to change it within 12 months. It is possible to take a couple of short vacations or one longer period to relax, but it is important to take it anyway. The only thing you should do is to sit together with your spouse, set up dates, decide where you are going or even buy tickets not to change your mind. 2. Pay for it If you plan a vacation, it is natural that you need to fund it. Experts advise saving some percentage of your salary each month on it. It can be a bank account or just some separate box at home where you save money only on travels. Otherwise, it can be a problem to find money and have fun since you will not have earnings at this time.  If you have money, you can afford to make your vacation memorable. It is very important to change your routine and a regular place of living for something absolutely different. Getting into a different atmosphere fills you with new strength and you are charged for the next working year thanks to that. 3. Unplug Real estate agents have got used to the feeling of being required. They believe that their clients cannot live without them, but the reality is different. Vacation is the time when you do not need to think of anything connected with work or repairs. It is time to calm down but how can you do that? If you have a colleague, ask him or her to cover you for the period of your vacation. Even if you are worried about your clients, nobody prohibits to communicate with them and a person to substitute you. Moreover, it is very important to warn your clients about the vacation planned or you will be unable to enjoy the solitude and time with family because of the constant calls.  Vacation is a necessity for every working person since once you head may stop working from a constant loading on it. Real estate agents deserve rest as much as other employees, that is why it is important to find time in your schedule for a vacation and enjoy it to the full extent to charge for one more year of routine and job responsibilities. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'How to plan a vacation for real estate agent', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'how-to-plan-a-vacation-for-real-estate-agent', '', '', '2019-08-13 08:10:58', '2019-08-13 12:10:58', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15483', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It is not a secret that some agents compete in the number of homes sold per week, month or year. Each of them has his or her own maximum and put much effort to beat this record. In fact, it is a kind of stimulus to work harder and increase your earnings.  You will agree that selling one home a day is a great achievement, but what is a record? Look: Ben Caballero sells 92 homes a week having beaten his own Guinness Book Record of 2016. What is his key to success? Read out the article and learn the secret.  Ben Caballero is the top real estate broker in the US who sold 4,799 homes in 2017. If to divide this sum into the number of weeks, it is about 92 homes a week on average. The total cost of this real estate exceeds $1.9 billion, so Real Trends awarded him with a title of the top US broker.  What is interesting, Ben Caballero has beaten his own record of 2016 which was added to the Guinness Book of records. One year earlier, he managed to sell 3,556 homes within a year and take the prize.  People may think that Ben is lucky to work in such busy areas as California or Washington, but he lives and works in Texas.  What is the key to his success? According to Caballero, he managed to set these records because of the narrow specialization he deals with. There are many specialties in real estate business. Some agents sell luxury property, others prefer to deal with commercial or industrial property, the third group suggests leasing homes for sale. The specialization of Ben’s company is a newly-constructed residential property in Texas. He cooperates only with companies who build homes in big volumes - over 3,000 homes a year. Many of these homes are sold at the level of their construction, the rest is sold by Ben’s company. He has launched a website HomesUSA especially for such large companies which help to keep track of all these homes. One more great achievement made is having streamlined the process of listing creation - it takes about 13 minutes to make up every listing. Moreover, this platform follows the progress of construction with images added by the employees and indicates when the building is already completed. According to Caballero, it would take hours and tons of paper to do the same without this platform. That is why many building companies choose his platform for selling homes.  <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'The top real estate broker joined Guinness Book records men', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'the-top-real-estate-broker-joined-guinness-book-records-men', '', '', '2019-08-20 06:21:13', '2019-08-20 10:21:13', '', 0, 'https://www.spotlessagency.com/?p=15494', 0, 'post', '', 1);

Another point brought about along with technological boost is accessibility to a bigger amount of data and information: more accurate and well-considered decisions can be made thanks to that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, technology awareness is very important if you are employed in real estate business and even customers support the point that realtors should keep up with modern trends in technology if they want to be in demand.

Tea, biscuits, flowers and silent music are used for this purpose. Other important tricks of how to make a home more appealing on showing are getting rid of animals, opening curtains wide and switching on the light, place decluttering and depersonalization.

Naturally, there are sellers who want to hide some defects and do that professionally enough that even experts can’t spot them. Consequently, realtors are not able to tell buyers all the secrets about a property simply because they do not know about them. Moreover, according to <strong>realtor</strong> ethics, they also do not comment if any house for sale is haunted or has any mysterious features. It is better to visit neighbors for this purpose rather than rely on the real estate agent.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>They are available round the clock</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"id":15568,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/They-are-available-round-the-clock-1024x682.jpg" alt="They are available round the clock" class="wp-image-15568"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A job of a <strong>real estate broker</strong> can be also compared with one of a therapist who accepts calls from the patients round the clock. Since home sales and purchases are very stressful processes, many clients do not mind calling at late hours or early in the morning if they have any questions. It is important to find a compromise in the relationships of a realtor and a client, especially if it is a couple or a family whose vision of the future property can be absolutely different.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3> Little slips can cost them a job or a fortune </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> People are not insured against mistakes but real estate agents do not have a right to make them. If he or she forgets to call back a client within certain time frames or misses anything, there are high chances that this job can be lost forever.

The range of emotions can be various but it is important to find necessary words to calm down and convince an interlocutor. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3> They have their own dialect </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> There is a vocabulary understood only by people of a certain profession and the real estate sphere is not an exception. For example, the phrase ‘motivated seller’ means that the property is not in the best condition so the price is negotiable. The word ‘Charming’ can be used instead of small, while the word ’mature’ substitutes everything that is old.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3> They hurry to close deals faster </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {"id":15569,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.spotlessagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/They-hurry-to-close-deals-faster-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15569"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is not in the interest of a real estate agent to delay anything working on a deal.

It is especially important when a person plans to take a mortgage and has already prepared all the documents and finances as well as was pre-approved.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> At the same time, there is another side of the medal when it comes to the prepared clients.

The reason for that is the fact that this price has been determined on the basis of a detailed comparative analysis, research of the neighborhood and real estate experience of working with appraisers. In any case, it will be close to the one you will see after appraisal so there is no sense to get on other people’s nerves to get a big discount. Of course, there are cases when homeowners want to maximize their profits and set higher prices, but it is easy to guess such homes comparing them with others and only in this case, there is sense to discuss the price.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->\n<h3>Selling homes is not the only responsibility of theirs</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you think that realtors spend their long working days looking for homes for sale, you are mistaken.
